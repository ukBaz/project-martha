Objective
---------

The goal of this project is to enable people to get started on developing ideas quickly on the `Dragonboard 410c
<https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/>`_ Single Board Computer. This project has primarily been
driven by the need to get up and running quickly at STEM outreach events or hackathons where there is
little infrastructure. This means the project prioritizes ease of setup for expected activities.

Project Martha aims to provide a Linux image that will allow a host computer (laptop) to connect via USB to the
Dragonboard 410c and be presented with a development environment in the browser.
A demo of the original proof-of-concept is available on `YouTube
